## Prerequisites

- Experience with
  [React fundamentals](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/react-fundamentals)

## Pre-workshop Resources

Here are some resources you can read before taking the workshop to get you up to
speed on some of the tools and concepts we'll be covering:

- [Why React Hooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWsZcBiwgVE&list=PLV5CVI1eNcJgNqzNwcs4UKrlJdhfDjshf)
  (35 minutes)
- [Getting Closure on Hooks](https://www.swyx.io/getting-closure-on-hooks/)
- [React Hooks Documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks)
- [Rules of Hooks](https://react.dev/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning)

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2.18 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] v20 or greater
- [npm][npm] v8 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

This is a pretty large project (it's actually many apps in one) so it can take
several minutes to get everything set up the first time. Please have a strong
network connection before running the setup and grab a snack.

Follow these steps to get this set up:

```sh nonumber
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/epicweb-dev/react-hooks.git
cd react-hooks
npm run setup
```

If you experience errors here, please open [an issue][issue] with as many
details as you can offer.

## Starting the app

Once you have the setup finished, you can start the app with:

```
npm start
```

## The Workshop App

Learn all about the workshop app on the
[Epic Web Getting Started Guide](https://www.epicweb.dev/get-started).
