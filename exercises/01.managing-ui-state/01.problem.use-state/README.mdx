👨‍💼 We've got you working on a blog search page. Allow me to introduce you to
🧝‍♂️ Kellie the coworker who put this together.

🧝‍♂️ Hello! I'm Kellie the coworker and I do things for you sometimes. I've
started up this app that you're going to be working with. There's a search
input, a couple checkboxes, a submit button, and a list of blog posts. You've
been asked to make it so when the user types into the search field it filters
the list of blog posts. And when the checkboxes are checked, we want to update
the filter for the user to include those values. You might find it helpful to
review the code before you get started.

👨‍💼 Thanks Kellie! Ok, so we're going to take this step-by-step. For this first
step, we just want you to create a state variable for the user's query and pass
that along to the `<MatchingPosts />`.
