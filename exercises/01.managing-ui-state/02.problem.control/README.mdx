# Controlling Inputs

👨‍💼 When the user clicks on one of the checkboxes, we want to auto-fill that
value into the search input for them. This means we need to "control" the input
value so we can set it programmatically. We can do this by using the `value`
prop on the input.

📜 You can read up more on this in the React docs:
[Controlling an input with a state variable](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/input#controlling-an-input-with-a-state-variable)

Once we add the query as the value for the input, we'll also want to have a
function responsible for updating the query when the user checks or unchecks the
checkboxes and call that in the `onChange` handler of the checkboxes.

Good luck!
