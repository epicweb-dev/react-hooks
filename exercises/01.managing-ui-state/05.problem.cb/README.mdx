# Init Callback

🦉 There's one more thing you should know about `useState` initialization and
that is a small performance optimization. `useState` can accept a function.

You may recall from earlier we mentioned that the first argument to `useState`
is only used during the initial render. It's not used on subsequent renders.
This is because the initial value is only used when the component is first
rendered. After that, the value is managed by React and you use the updater
function to update it.

But imagine a situation where calculating that initial value were
computationally expensive. It would be a waste to compute the initial value for
all but the initial render right? That's where the function form of `useState`
comes in.

Let's imagine we have a function that calculates the initial value and it's
computationally expensive:

```tsx
const [val, setVal] = useState(calculateInitialValue())
```

This will work just fine, but it's not ideal. The `calculateInitialValue` will
be called on every render, even though it's only needed for the initial render.
So instead of calling the function, we can just pass it:

```tsx
const [val, setVal] = useState(calculateInitialValue)
```

Typically doing this is unnecessary, but it's good to know about in case you
need it.

So

```tsx
// both of these work just fine:
const [query, setQuery] = useState(getQueryParam())
const [query, setQuery] = useState(getQueryParam)
```

You're going to be making the `getQueryParam` function. Got it? Great, let's go!
