# Managing UI State

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-hooks/intro-to-managing-ui-state" />

Dynamic applications allow users to interact and make changes to what they see
on the page and the application should respond by updating the UI based on what
the user has done. We accomplish this by using state. When state changes (for
example as the result of user interaction and input), we update the UI. Here's
how that works with React:

![render --> set up the DOM --> user interacts --> state changes --> re-render --> update the DOM --> return to user interacts](/react-app-lifecycle.png)

There's a cycle of user interaction, state changes, and re-rendering. This
is the core of how React works for interactive applications.

The `render` phase is what we've done so far with creating React elements.
Handling user interactions is what we do with event listeners like `onChange`.
Now we're going to get into the `state changes` bit.

In React, you use special functions called "hooks" to do this. Common built-in
hooks include:

- `useState`
- `useRef`
- `use`
- `useReducer`
- `useEffect`

Each of these is a special function that you can call inside your custom React
component function to store data (like state) or perform actions (or
side-effects). There are a few more built-in hooks that have special use cases,
but the ones above are what you'll be using most of the time.

Each of the hooks has a unique API. Some return a value (like `useRef` and
`use`), others return a pair of values (like `useState` and
`useReducer`), and others return nothing at all (like `useEffect`).

Here's an example of a component that uses the `useState` hook and an onClick
event handler to update that state:

```tsx
function Counter() {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
	const increment = () => setCount(count + 1)
	return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>
}
```

`useState` is a function that accepts a single argument. That argument is
the initial state for the instance of the component. In our case, the state will
start as `0`.

`useState` returns a pair of values. It does this by returning an array
with two elements (and we use destructuring syntax to assign each of those
values to distinct variables). The first of the pair is the state value and the
second is a function we can call to update the state. We can name these
variables whatever we want. Common convention is to choose a name for the state
variable, then prefix `set` in front of that for the updater function.

State can be defined as: data that changes over time. So how does this work over
time? When the button is clicked, our `increment` function will be called at
which time we update the `count` by calling `setCount`.

When we call `setCount`, that tells React to re-render our component. When it
does this, the entire `Counter` function is re-run, so when `useState` is
called this time, the value we get back is the value that we called `setCount`
with. And it continues like that until `Counter` is unmounted (removed from the
application), or the user closes the application.

Note that after the initial render, the argument passed to `useState` is
ignored. The only time it's used is when the component is first created. The
only way to change the state value of the component while it's around is to
call the updater function returned by `useState`.
