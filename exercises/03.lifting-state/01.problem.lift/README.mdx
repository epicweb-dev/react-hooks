# Lift State

🧝‍♂️ I refactored the app a bit. In the process I kinda broke stuff and you'll be
required to fix it. Feel free to <DiffLink app1={-1} app2={0}>check the diff</DiffLink>
to know what I've done. I pretty much just moved stuff into separate components
to get a little more organization in here.

🧝‍♂️ Oh, also I added a new feature. You can now "like" specific posts by clicking
a little heart on the post. How nice! It's not persisted anywhere yet, so when
you refresh the page the likes all get reset, but it's a nice start!

👨‍💼 Great, now your job is to fix what's broken. You need to move not only the
state, but also we're going to have you move the `useEffect` that sets the query
as well.

Then you're going to need to pass props to the components as needed. Enjoy!
