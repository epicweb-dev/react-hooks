# Handle Errors

Unfortunately, sometimes things go wrong and we need to handle errors when they
do so we can show the user useful information. Handle that error and render it
out like so:

```jsx
<div role="alert">
  There was an error: <pre style={{whiteSpace: 'normal'}}>{error.message}</pre>
</div>
```

You can make an error happen by typing an incorrect pokemon name into the input.

One common question I get about this extra credit is how to handle promise
errors. There are two ways to do it in this extra credit:

```javascript
// option 1: using .catch
fetchPokemon(pokemonName)
  .then(pokemon => setPokemon(pokemon))
  .catch(error => setError(error))

// option 2: using the second argument to .then
fetchPokemon(pokemonName).then(
  pokemon => setPokemon(pokemon),
  error => setError(error),
)
```

These are functionally equivalent for our purposes, but they are semantically
different in general.

Using `.catch` means that you'll handle an error in the `fetchPokemon` promise,
but you'll _also_ handle an error in the `setPokemon(pokemon)` call as well.
This is due to the semantics of how promises work.

Using the second argument to `.then` means that you will catch an error that
happens in `fetchPokemon` only. In this case, I knew that calling `setPokemon`
would not throw an error (React handles errors and we have an API to catch those
which we'll use later), so I decided to go with the second argument option.

However, in this situation, it doesn't really make much of a difference. If you
want to go with the safe option, then opt for `.catch`.
